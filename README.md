# LOL-Itemization-Model


This project uses machine learning to predict recommended items for a League of Legends champion based on the current game state and champion-specific features. The project involves data preprocessing, encoding, model training, and an inference pipeline to provide item recommendations in real-time.

## Features

- **Data Retrieval**: API calls to get the right data for the match
- **Data Transformation**:  Encoding and cleaning raw game data for model training.
- **Real-time Inference**: Using a trained model to make item recommendations during gameplay.

## Next steps

- Removing item components from the final output (and preferrably model training) to focus only on core items
- Adding item icons
- Package the project to make it available for pip install
